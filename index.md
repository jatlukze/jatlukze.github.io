### [Detect Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray Images](https://github.com/jatlukze/Thinkful_Projects/blob/master/Final/Thinkful_Final_Capstone_Project_Detect_Pneumonia_using_Chest_X_Ray_Images.ipynb)
According to World Health Organization (WHO), 2 million children under 5 years old killed by pneumonia each year, and WHO reported that 95% of childhood clinical pneumonia cases occurred in developing countries (Kermany, 2018). X-ray images is one of the key elements for diagnosing pneumonia, since X-ray images are able to obtained as standard care procedure, and help differentiate between different types of pneumonia. However, specialist for interpreting the images are not always available, especially in low-resource areas. Therefore, we can utilize neural network technique to act as the primary screening to detect pneumonia using chest X-ray images.
<br/>
This data set contains more than 5 thousands chest X-ray images. However, data augmentation is needed to increase our sample size and create a unbiased traing data set. A Convolutional Neural Network model is built to classified X-ray images, and this model achieved 86.86% validation accuracy.
